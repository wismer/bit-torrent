Torrenter
=========

A simple implementation of a BitTorrent client using the programming language ruby. As of last edit, this
version supports TCP and UDP trackers, but there is no support for scraping and the download strategy has not
been optimized. This is partly due to the future plans I have with torrenter, which include something similar to the 
popular popcorn movie viewer.

To start using, first install

  gem install torrenter

then download the torrent, `cd` to it in the terminal and finally, simply type in `torrenter torrent_file`.
